# Overview

This project aims to study the relationships between age-related hearing loss (ARHL), tinnitus, and various health conditions (comorbidities) using data from multiple large-scale epidemiological studies. The goal is to better understand how ARHL and tinnitus are associated with conditions such as anxiety, asthma, Alzheimer’s disease (AD)/dementia, depression, cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, diabetes, obesity, sleep disorders, and stroke. We will use diverse datasets to ensure broad representation across different racial, ethnic, and ancestral groups.

# Objectives

1. **Identify Comorbidities Associated with ARHL and Tinnitus**  
   - Examine the prevalence and patterns of comorbidities in individuals with ARHL and tinnitus.
   - Compare findings across different racial, ethnic, and ancestral groups.

2. **Understand Direct and Indirect Relationships**  
   - Use mediation analysis to determine whether observed associations are direct or influenced by other factors.
   - For example, investigate whether the link between obesity and ARHL is mediated through high blood pressure.

3. **Utilize Multiple Data Sources for Robust Analysis**  
   - Analyze data from multiple epidemiological studies, including NHANES, NHATS, NHIS, UK Biobank (UKB), and All of Us (AoU).
   - Assess consistency of findings across different datasets and methodologies.

# Data Sources

- **NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)**: A U.S. study combining interviews, physical exams, and hearing tests.
- **NHATS (National Health and Aging Trends Study)**: Focuses on older adults in the U.S. and collects information on health, function, and disability.
- **NHIS (National Health Interview Survey)**: Provides broad health information on U.S. adults and allows analysis of multiple health characteristics.
- **UK Biobank (UKB) & All of Us (AoU)**: Large-scale genetic and health data resources with diverse participants.

# Steps in the Study

1. **Data Selection and Preparation**
   - Select relevant participants (e.g., older adults aged 40+ for consistency across datasets).
   - Define and standardize measures of ARHL, tinnitus, and comorbidities.
   
2. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Examine associations between ARHL/tinnitus and comorbidities using appropriate statistical models.
   - Compare these associations across different racial/ethnic/ancestral groups.
   - Perform meta-analysis to combine results from multiple datasets.

3. **Mediation Analysis**
   - Identify whether certain conditions act as intermediaries between ARHL/tinnitus and other comorbidities.
   - Example: Test whether depression mediates the association between ARHL and Alzheimer’s disease.

4. **Sensitivity Analyses**
   - Compare findings between different age groups (e.g., 40-64 vs. 65+).
   - Use alternative hearing loss measures, including audiometry data where available.

# Expected Outcomes

- A comprehensive understanding of how ARHL and tinnitus are linked to various health conditions.
- Insights into whether these relationships differ by racial/ethnic/ancestral background.
- Identification of potential pathways through which comorbidities influence ARHL and tinnitus.

# Importance of the Study

Hearing loss and tinnitus affect millions of people, particularly older adults, and often occur alongside other health conditions. By identifying these relationships, we can improve early detection, prevention, and management strategies, ultimately enhancing quality of life for those affected.

This project provides an opportunity to work with large-scale epidemiological data, develop analytical skills, and contribute to meaningful public health research.
